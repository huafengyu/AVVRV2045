## Vision 2045 of Verification & Validation for Autonomy

Industry is developing autonomous solutions that expand the role of aviation in our daily lives and deliver faster services to society at large. Many of those new aeronautical-related services will start with humans in control; but are expected to evolve towards increasingly autonomous solutions in order to remain economically viable. The roles of humans will shift from controlling to monitoring as technical solutions rely more and more on technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, i.e., machine learning, reinforcement learning, multi-objective optimization, and planning & scheduling. The shift will be progressive and require increasingly pervasive use of runtime monitoring. Moreover, as “smarter” technologies are increasingly utilized on both ground and airborne systems, the assurance needs will also evolve. As design-time and operational safety merge together, V&V will have to expand and morph into novel runtime solutions. As the landscape of autonomy changes so does safety assurance and software V&V.

The goal of this effort "Vision 2045 of Verification & Validation for Autonomy" is to build that comprehensive list of V&V needs, develop a roadmap to achieve them, identify the services they can enable, and point to the certification gaps they fill. This effort will serve as support for NASA’s internal, long range, planning exercises which will inform the funding requirements that support this evolution of technology. Questions that need to be addressed include:
1. What are the new technologies needed to enable increasingly autonomous air services? Each new technology should be accompanied by examples of services it enables.
2. What are the limitations of current V&V capabilities with respect to these new technologies? For example, are current testing techniques sufficient for deploying MLenabled systems? Answers should consider the projected use of these technologies as well as their possible re-use in different contexts (applications, environments, and so on).
3. Where do the current certification standards (such as DO-178C) fail to address assurance needs for these technologies or fail to take into account V&V results associated with the new technologies?
4. What role can new certification approaches such as Overarching Properties or safety cases play in the certification of increasingly autonomous systems?
5. What paradigm shifts in the existing regulations are necessary to implement new certification approaches?
6. How will the assurance of cyber-physical-human systems need to change to accommodate shifting roles and responsibilities between humans and automation? What new technologies will be required to assure anticipated systems architectures? How will we account for the implicit contributions to safety that are provided by humans in today’s systems?

While the individual needs of external customers/organizations/agencies and application domains will vary greatly, they need to be identified so that the community including industry, academia and government agencies can each determine what they can address given their means and their particular focus. To identify these threads, a realistic definition of a “Vision 2045 of V&V for Autonomy” is expected to be built. This effort will involve development of a mapping from V&V needs to technologies to enabled services with a particular interest in how new V&V technologies can fill existing or anticipated gaps in the regulatory framework. Furthermore, since the increasing use of autonomy implies a shift in the role played by humans, new V&V approaches addressing the changing roles and responsibilities should be addressed. At a minimum, the aforementioned questions should be answered with defensible positions. 

## Autonomy V&V Roadmap and Vision 2045 project
To create the Vision 2045 of V&V for Autonomy and a roadmap to achieve this vision, a collaboration team of recognized researchers from industry and academia was built, with support from government agencies:
- NASA Program Manager: Guillaume Brat
- Boeing Principle Investigator: Huafeng Yu
- Technical team
   - Collins Aerosapce Lead: Darren Cofer
   - GE Research Lead: Mike Durling
   - MIT Lead: Chuchu Fan
   - UT Austin Lead: Ufuk Topcu
   - University of Michigan Leads: Ella Atkins \& Prashin Santosh Sharma 
- NASA panelists:
- FAA advisors:
- AFRL advisors:
- NRL advisors:
- Boeing advisors: 

Expected Outcomes of this project include:
- A list of the V&V technologies needed to enable the use of autonomy in aviation.
- A mapping of the V&V needs to (possibly AI-based) technologies and the enabled services in aviation.
- A study of the gaps in the current certification processes and an assessment of potential technologies that could fill those gaps.
- Answers to the above six questions, and other questions deemed relevant by the proposer, including thorough justification for all answers.

## Autonomy Verification & Validaton Workshop
To support this project, an Autonomy Verification \& Validaton workshop will be held on May 23, 2022 in Boeing' El Segundo site. The participants are not limited to our project team members, but a visitor's badge is required, and should be applied 2 weeks before the workshop.
